# ðŸ‘‹ Hello from My Practice Hands-On AWS Cloud Project

Welcome to my AWS Cloud project repository!

This project is part of my hands-on learning journey with AWS services.  
Here, I explore and practice building scalable, reliable, and secure cloud solutions using core AWS services like EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, IAM, and more.

Feel free to explore, learn, and share feedback!

ðŸš€ Happy Cloud Building!
